# Research UCLA

ACM AI is trying to develop a website to give students more information about opportunities on campus. These involve research, graduate school, news, etc but we need help fleshing out the website for native and mobile.

View deployed website here: https://nervous-mclean-170fe2.netlify.com/

# Development

Branches should be in the format of `<yourname>/<feature>` e.g. `yvonne/add-navbar`

To start off, install dependencies with:

### `yarn` or `yarn install`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
